## 3D calculations on errors

### Error from calibrating waist in experiments

### Numerical error from N and R convergences

#### R convergence

#### N convergence

The extrapolation is slightly hard to obtain as at high frequency the error of fitted lifetime is random.

## 1D tests

### Absorption strenth

As we have already known, the Zeno effect is observed at large absorption limit, and for a wide range of strength (in the theoretically estimated window) the lifetime remains unchanged.

### Stop time

The lifetime from dynamics of different stop time. THe 1st curve has inaccurate lifetime because its stop times are smaller than the driving period. The other curves agree well, showing an irrelavence of our fitting results vs. stop time.

## TODOs

1. Make linear error addition
2. Estimate lifetime by Fermiâ€™s golden rule
3. Write Method part of the paper
