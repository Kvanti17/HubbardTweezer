a0 = 5.29177e-11  # Bohr radius, in unit of meter
# micron = 1000  # Length scale micrn, in unit of nm
# Eha = 6579.68392E12 * 2 * np.pi  # Hartree energy, in unit of Hz

h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant
# l = 780E-9 / a0  # 780nm, light wavelength

dim = 3  # space dimension

# NOTE: 1. Harmonic length \propto sqrt(w)
#       2. All length units are in wx, wy are rep by a factor wy/wx.
#          z direction zRx, zRy are also in unit of wx.
